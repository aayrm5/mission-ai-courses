    "# Module 4 - Control Structures (Conditional Logic, Loops)\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this module, you will get comfortable with writing conditional logic using IF-ELSE statements, as well as using Loops for iteration / repetition. We have already learnt about all of Python's major data types, variables and operators; we will start putting them together into programs that generate specific outputs for specific conditions, which is how most real-world programming tasks are structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## *1. What is conditional logic?*\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional logic is a `structured way of generating outputs based on conditions or criteria`. The following statements are examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "> If the hotel guest is female, \n",
    "    say 'Welcome Ma'am'.\n",
    "Else \n",
    "    say 'Welcome Sir'\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the student scores more than 90%, \n",
    "    give a Gold Medal. \n",
    "Else if the student scores between 70% and 90%\n",
    "    give a Silver Medal. \n",
    "Else give a Bronze Medal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## *2. Using `if-elif-else` to implement conditional logic*:\n",
    "---\n",
    "Python provides the `if-elif-else` framework for us to write conditional logic. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if (condition_1):\n",
    "    do action_1\n",
    "\n",
    "elif (condition_2):\n",
    "    do action_2\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    do action_3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few important points to note: \n",
    "- You can `either include the brackets or exclude them`. Personally, I prefer using brackets. \n",
    "- `Remember the colon` after each of the conditions and keywords\n",
    "- The code for each line belonging to each of the blocks should be `indented` (tab or 4 spaces). That's how Python understands what is part of a block and what is not\n",
    "- You can include `any number of elif conditions`\n",
    "- The condition can include literally `anything that evaluates to True / False` - you can combine arithmetic / relational / logical operators, 'in' keyword, different data types / variables, etc.\n",

    "## *8. Nested FOR Loops*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we have data structures that are nested, like a list of lists, or a dictionary where the values are lists. And to iterate over these nested data structures, we need loops that are nested. Lets look at some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6,7],[8,9,10,11,12]]`\n",
    "Here we need one outer loop to iterate over all the items of the outer list, and one inner loop to iterate over each inner list item.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `{\"key1\":[1,2,3,4,5],\"key2\":[10,100,100],\"key3\":[15,30,45,60]}`\n",
    "Here we need one outer loop to iterate over all the keys of the dictionary, and one inner loop to iterate over each corresponding value, which is a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now see how to use nested `for` loops in Python:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# list of lists\n",
    "lst = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6,7],[8,9,10,11,12]]\n",
    "for index, inner_list in enumerate(lst):\n",
    "    print(\"list #\" + str(index))\n",
    "    for item in inner_list:\n",
    "        print(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "# dictionary with list values\n",
    "dct = {\"key1\":[1,2,3,4,5],\"key2\":[10,100,100],\"key3\":[15,30,45,60]}\n",
    "for key in dct.keys():\n",
    "    print(\"key: \" + key)\n",
    "    for item in dct[key]:\n",
    "        print(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just remember to think of each layer separately. You might have JSON files with many levels of nesting, but it is easy to break it down into small, understandable chunks. Remember that {} refers to dictionaries or sets, [] to lists and () to tuples. Use the appropriate loops to iterate over each component of the data structure. "
