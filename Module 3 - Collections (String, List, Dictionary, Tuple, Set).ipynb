    "The String data type holds `text data`, i.e., its contents are treated as a sequence of characters. Python does not have a character data type, so every character is treated as a string of length 1. While String can be treated like a basic data type, it also has numerous operations that are similar to the \"List\" data type. For that reason, it is included in this module on Python collections. Strings are immutable, i.e., you cannot change the vaule of string once it is created.\n",
