    "# Module 1 - Introduction to Python\n",
    "---\n",
    "This module is intended to provide you with context about the Python language, its uses in industry and also a practical guide to get started with minimal fuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## _1. What is Python ?_\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **general-purpose, high-level, interpreted** programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets break that statement down, bit by bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `general-purpose programming language` is designed to be used for writing software in the widest variety of application domains. It does not include domain-specific language constructs. Examples are Java, C, PHP, Visual Basic, etc. The opposite of a general-purpose programming language is a domain-specific programming language. Examples of domain-specific programming languages: HTML for constructing web pages, SQL for communciating with databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `high-level programming language` is a programming language which hides away inner details of the computer like registers, memory addresses and call stacks. It abstracts the details of machine hardware, making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. High-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "An `interpreted language` is a type of programming language where there is no separate step of compiling a program into machine-language instructions. However, an intermediate (machine-language) respresentation is automatically created for us. In the case of Python, the intermediate representation is created each time there is a change in the source before execution. In the case of Ruby, it is created each time before execution. In the case of Java (a compiled language), the intermediate representation is created once and for all by compiling into .class file. Interpreted languages are typically called scripting languages, like PHP, Perl, Python (Server-side) & Javascript (Client-side).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## _2. Some fun facts about Python:_\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created and released by `Guido Van Rossum` in 1991. He has been named the \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" by the Python community\t\n",
    "- `Open-source license`, which means it can be freely used and distributed, even for commerical purposes\t\n",
    "- Administered by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org)\t\n",
    "- Python has a lot of additional libraries and packages. `PyPI` - the Python Package Index is the official repository of all 3rd party Python software\n",
    "- `pip` is the recommended package manager for Python. It installs libraries from the PyPI repository\t\n",
    "- Python is written in C, so you will see a lot of cases where companies use Python in combination with C/C++\t\n",
    "- Python has a strong focus on readability with `indentation` and blocks. It has clean, precise syntax, making it easy to learn\n",
    "- It is considered a `batteries-included` programming language due to its comprehensive standard library (core functionality)\n",
    "- From 1st Jan, 2020, only Python versions >= 3.5 are supported, and Python 2.x version support is discontinued\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## _3. Main uses of Python:_\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Science**: *Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence workflows, Scientific & Numerical Computing*. \n",
    "> Several surveys show that Python is the most popular platform in the data science industry for Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI. Many of the most popular ML/DL libraries like scikit-learn, tensorflow and keras are native to Python. Python also beats R in execution speed. However, R is popular in the academic and research worlds. R still holds a slight edge in statistical analysis and data visualization\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "- **Web development**: *Back-end server-side development using Django, Pyramid, Flask frameworks*\n",
    "> Instagram currently features the world’s largest deployment of the Django web framework, which is written entirely in Python.\n",
    "> Google has a \"Python where we can, C++ where we must.” policy. \n",
    "> YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, Uber and Dropbox all use Python for back-end development.\t\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "- **General-purpose programming**: *Achieving tasks through code, automating routine tasks, etc.*\n",
    "> Python is a multi-paradigm language - supporting procedural, object-oriented as well as functional programming. Some common programming tasks include scraping the web, processing data, creating commercial software, and building graphical user interfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## _4. Installation and Setup:_\n",
    "---\n",
    "To install and set up Python on your computer, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A) Getting python**:\n",
    "> - You can download the Python installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads). Installers are available for Windows, Mac and Linux.\n",
    ">- You can also get [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which is the most popular Python distribution for Data Science - it comes pre-loaded with all the data science libraries that you'll need.\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "- **B) Running the installer**:\n",
    ">- Execute the installer. It will install Python on your system. \n",
    ">- Make sure to select the \"Add Python to PATH\" option during installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **C) Check if the PATH environment variable has been set correctly**:\n",
    ">- The PATH variable stores the locations of different directories where your executable files and binaries exist. Whenever you type any command in the terminal, or when one program calls another without its whole path, the OS first tries to find the command definition in the current working directory, and then in all the paths mentioned in PATH variable.\n",
    ">- In Windows, navigate to \"Environment Variables\" in system settings and locate the \"Path\" environment variable. It should contain the Python Application path and the Python Scripts path. \n",
    ">- If it hasn't been set already, you can also add Python to your path manually. Navigate to \"Environment Variables\" in system settings and locate the \"Path\" environment variable (create it if it doesn't exist). You will need to add 2 folders to the \"Path\" variable: The Python application path, which is the folder where you originally installed Python; and The Python Scripts path. The Scripts folder should be located within the Python application path. Add the complete paths, and make sure you add semi-colons as separators.\n",
    ">- In Mac and Linux, add the Python directory (/usr/local/bin/python) to the PATH environment variable in the ksh or bash shell\t\t\t\n",
    "- **D) Test your Python installation**:\n",
    ">- Open a command line prompt, and run the following command: `python --version` (or `python3 --version`). It should show you the version of Python installed on your machine. \n",
    ">- If it throws an error, make sure that you have add the Python directories to the PATH environment variable.\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "Python is now installed and set up successfully on your system. You're now ready to build write and run your first program\t\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "## _5. Choosing your Python development environment:_\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You can select any of the following options to develop Python programs:\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "- **A) Using Python in Interactive Mode**:\n",
    "> - This option is also called \"read–eval–print loop (REPL)\"\t\n",
    "> - Open up a command prompt (cmd)\t\t\n",
    "> - Type the following command: `python` (or `python3`)\n",
    "> - The program will now enter interactive mode. Type in your code. It gets executed when you press enter. Once you're done, type \"quit()\" or \"Ctrl Z\" and hit Enter\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "- **B) Text Editor like Notepad**:\n",
    "> - Write your code in any text editor. Save the file with a \".py\" extension\t\t\t\n",
    "> - Open up a command prompt (cmd)\t\t\t\n",
    "> - Type the following command: `python path_to_your_file\\file_name.py` (or `python3 path_to_your_file\\file_name.py`)\n",
    "> - The program will now be executed, and you will see the output in the console\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "- **C) Free IDE like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm Community edition**:\n",
    "> - Within Visual Studio Code, install the \"Python\" extension\t\t\t\n",
    "> - It automatically detects the Python interpreter that is referenced in the PATH variable\t\t\t\n",
    "> - Create your .py file, write the code and execute from within the IDE, either with the \"Run\" button or using the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)\n",
    "> - Using an IDE is a good option since has code completion and intellisense. So writing code becomes easier and quicker, and you can do everything you need without leaving the IDE\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "- **D) Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "> - It is an interactive computing environment that lets you create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text\n",
    "> - If you installed the standard Python distribution, then type the command `pip install jupyterlab`\t\t\t\n",
    "> - If you have the Anaconda distribution, Jupyter Notebook is already installed. (Just open Anaconda Navigator and then open Jupyter Notebook from within that environment)\n",
    "> - To run Jupyter Notebook, just run the following command in the command line prompt: `jupyter notebook`. It will open a new tab in your web browser.\t\t\t\n",
    "> - Create a new jupyter notebook file (.ipynb extension), write your code in the code cells and run each code cell as and when required\n",
    "> - To stop Jupyter Notebook, type \"Ctrl C\" in the command prompt where you started Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "- **E) Google Colab**:\n",
    "> - Google Colab is like Jupyter Notebook for your Google Drive. All the computation is done in the cloud. \t\t\t\n",
    "> - Go to https://colab.research.google.com/\t\t\t\n",
    "> - Just like with Jupyter Notebook on your system, you can Create a new notebook, type your code into a Code Cell, Save the notebook and run it. \t\n",
