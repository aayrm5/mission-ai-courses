    "# Module 8 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this module, you will learn about how Python supports Object-Oriented Programming. We will cover OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation along with detailed examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## *1. What is OOP*?\n",
    "As the name suggests, `object-oriented programming it is a programming paradigm where we think of everything in terms of objects`. `An object is composed of data (in the form of attributes) and functions to process that data (in the form of methods)`. By binding these together, we prevent unauthorized access by other parts of the code. We think of the entire real-world problem in terms of objects - the advantage being that we can define absolutely any kind of object that is specific to our problem. For example, in a CRM system, we create \"Customer\" objects - which have attributes (like name, contact details, organzation and designation) and methods to get and set these details (called getters and setters). OOP is one of many programming paradigms like functional programming, imperative proramming, etc that Python supports. \n",
    "\n",
    "## *2. Classes v/s objects*:\n",
    "We say that everything in Python is an object. What does that practically mean? It means that `classes` are defined for each type of object, specifying all their attributes (properties / variables) and methods (functions that do some processing or calculations). `A class is like a definition or blueprint`. `An object is the created version (or instance) of the class` - it has an id and reference. `Think of a class like a blueprint/plan for a building, and the object as the constructed real-world building`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our first look at classes and objects in action - lets take the building analogy forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class Building: # class name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    industry = \"Construction\" # class attribute\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, input_name, input_num_floors, input_residential): # constructor\n",
    "        # instance attributes - name, num_floors, residential\n",
    "        self.name = input_name\n",
    "        self.num_floors = input_num_floors\n",
    "        self.residential = input_residential\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def print_building_info(self): # method\n",
    "        output_msg = f\"\"\"\n",
    "        This building, which belongs in the {self.industry} industry, is named {self.name}. \n",
    "        It has {self.num_floors} floors and the residential_indicator is {self.residential}\n",
    "        \"\"\" \n",
    "        print(output_msg)\n",
    "                \n",
    "b = Building(\"Empire State Building\",102, False) # creating an instance called 'b', of the class 'Building'\n",
    "print(type(b)) # returns the type of object - class name\n",
    "print(b.name, b.num_floors, b.residential) # accessing the attributes of instance 'b'. \n",
    "# We could wrap the above variables in getter/setter methods \n",
    "\n",
    "print(b.__class__.industry) # accessing the class attribute of instance 'b'\n",
    "print(b.industry) # same result as above\n",
    "\n",
    "b.print_building_info() # calling the 'print_building_info' method of 'Building' object 'b'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important points to note in the example above:\n",
    "- The `class` keyword for classes is equivalent to the `def` keyword for functions. It is followed by the class name\n",
    "- `Class attributes` have the same value across all instances of the class. In this case, we wish to say that all buildings are built as part of the construction industry.\n",
    "- The `__init__` method is called a constructor, because it is used to construct an instance of the class. The `__init__` name is recognised by Python to contain all the instantiation code.\n",
    "- Instance attributes are typically assigned their values inside the constructor. They are specific to a particular instance of the class\n",
    "- `Methods are functions that belong to an object/class`. They can either perform an action like printing a message, or perform some calculation and return the result. They are accessed through the object, not stand-alone.\n",
    "- `All methods within a class take 'self' as the 1st argument`. They use this 'self' object to access all the available attributes and methods. However, when we create a new instance or call any method of the class, Python automatically figures out what 'self' means, so there is `no need to explicitly pass 'self' as an argument while calling a class method`.\n",
    "- To create an instance of a class, use the class name followed by the constructor inputs in parentheses. \n",
    "- To access attributes or methods of the instance, use `<instance_name>.<attribute_or_method_name>`"

    "## *3. Inheritance & Polymorphism*:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Inheritance` is one of the most important concepts in OOP, as it lets us build out structured solutions and also re-usable, modular code. Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties of another class. For example, a child inherits the attributes of its parents. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Polymorphism` refers to the ability to have multiple forms of the same function. All forms/versions of the function have the same name, but the contents of the function will differ. For example, a square and circle can both have a get_area() method, but they will contain different calcualations and return different results.  \n",

    "## *4. Encapsulation using Access Modifiers*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation or data-hiding, is the means by which the attributes of a class can be accessed only through a method within their own class. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Encapsulation is a means of protection that prevents the data from being accessed/manipulated by outside code. All attributes amd methods of a class are public by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a best practice, encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in the class as private (using double underscores) and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables (getters and setters). Remember that Python doesn't implement TRUE access modifiers. So we have to use a combination of Python programming conventions (single leading underscore) and name mangling (double leading underscore) to achieve some degree of encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `single leading underscore` before a class variable or method is an `indication` that this variable/method was meant to be used within the class for internal use. However, this 'private behaviour' is not enforced by the Python interpreter. You can still read and edit a variable that has a single leading underscore in its name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A `double leading underscore` before a class variable or method tells the interpreter to use `name mangling`, i.e., change the name of the variable in a way that makes it harder to create conflicts if the class is extended by a subclass later. Another programmer cannot directly access such a variable directly by name. However, if you enter the command dir(class_name), you will see the name by which the variable or method can be accessed.
