    "---\n",
    "This module is will provide with you with all the information you need about defining your own packages and modules, as well as using built-in and 3rd-party packages. We cover some of Python's most well-known modules like os, sys, math, statistics, random and datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## *1. Modules*:\n",
    "\n",
    "`A module is any file containing Python code and having a .py extension`. You can define variables, functions and classes in a module. For example, if you want to let a user access the following mathematical features:\n",
    "- The value of 'pi' (3.14157) in a variable called 'pi'\n",
    "- Use simple functions to calculate the square and cube of a number\n",
    "- A new type of Integer called 'PrintableInt' where the method get_pretty_string() returns a printable message with the value  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now define the variable, function and class described above in a Python file (say you call it 'my_math_module.py'). This is now a module called 'my_math_module'. Now `place the module in one of 3 locations`:\n",
    "- Current working directory.\n",
    "- Directories in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.\n",
    "- Python default installation directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python searches for the module in the order shown above. Sow we'll create this 'my_math_module.py' file and place it in the current working directory or any of the directories in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, with the code given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# variable 'pi'\n",
    "pi = 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "# functions to calculate square and cube of a number\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x**2\n",
    "\n",
    "def cube(x):\n",
    "    return x**3\n",

    "        return \"Value of PrintableInt: \" + str(self.value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a module that can be used. So how do we use it? We do so `using the 'import' statement`. When a module is imported and run, its functions will be imported, and top level code executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import my_math_module\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_math_module.pi) # variable\n",

    "i = my_math_module.PrintableInt(25) # class\n",
    "print(i.get_pretty_string())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can `use the 'as' keyword to rename the imported module, or gve it an alias`, in case the original name is too long to keep repeating. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import my_math_module as m\n",
    "print(m.pi) # variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Another way of importing modules is by using the 'from' keyword to specify exactly which parts of the module you want to import`. You can use the names of the imported variables directly, functions and classes without prefixing them with the module name. This also helps in avoiding loading entire modules when we need only a small part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "from my_math_module import pi, square, cube, PrintableInt\n",
    "\n",

    "print(cube(4))\n",
    "i = PrintableInt(25) # class\n",
    "print(i.get_pretty_string())\n",
    "```\n",
    "To get a list of all the variables/functions/classes in a module, use `dir()`. To get detailed documentation about the module, use `help()`\n",

A package is basically a hierarchical file directory structure which serves as a namespace containing multiple subpackages and/or modules`. At every directory level of the package, there should be an `__init__.py` file (This is a special type of file. It is okay if the file is empty, but it ususally contains explicit import statements for all the objects available from the module). Remember that the search path for modules and packages is the same. Packages and libraries are conceptually the same. The names are used interchangeably in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets understand packages with an example: \n",
    "- Create a directory called 'my_modules' in the current working directory - this serves as the package name. \n",
    "- Under the 'my_modules' directory, create an empty file called `__init__.py`. Also create a copy of the 'my_math_module.py' file we created in the lesson above. \n",
    "- Create a sub-package called 'supermath' by creating a directory with the same name. In it, place a copy of the 'supermath.py' file from the exercise above, as well as another empty `__init__.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
